## Configuring the Network

We executed an installation without network, which make it unable to acquire network address by operating system itself so we configure it manually.

### Configuring VM settings

Before booting the VM, we configure the VM itself firstly.

1. Make sure your VM is not running, select the VM you created in the sidebar and click `Settings`.
2. Click `Network` in the sidebar.
3. Make sure `Enable Network Adapter` in `Adapter 1` is checked and configure `Attached to` as `Bridged Adapter`.
4. The `Name` field will be enabled and what you should do is select the network device (wireless or wired network adapter) you are using.
5. Click `OK` to save the settings.

后面我们会介绍使用 SSH 工具连接虚拟机以便于操作，因此我们使用“桥接模式”的虚拟机网卡。在这个模式下，虚拟机网卡将模拟为和选定的网卡相同的一块网卡（你可以认为是电脑里复制出来了一块和物理网卡相同的一块网卡），这就意味着如果你现在使用的是有线网络，则需要在此处配置中选中有线网卡桥接。但当你更换为使用无线网卡上网时，进入虚拟机设置里面重新配置一下即可，反之亦然。

If your `Bridged Adapter` doesn't work correctly, you can switch it to `NAT` and enable `Adapter 2` and set it to `Host-only Adapter`, we call it double-adapter mode but we don't provide detailed instruction, if you encountered with this problem, search the Internet.

### Configuring OS Settings

Now start your VM and login as normal user. Check the network with command below:

```bash
ping 114.114.114.114 -c 4
```

In most of circumstances, you will receive a message telling you that:

```bash
connect: Network is unreachable
```

and this means we should also configure the settings of Debian manually.

Switch to **root** account by 

```bash
su
```

and execute command

```bash
ip addr
```

and you will see all network adapter in your VM. By default, the first interface is `lo` which represents the loopback network and what we should focus on is the second one:

```
2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
	link/ether 08:00:27:a4:55:95 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

*If you have only the `lo` interface, that means you don't turn on the `Adapter 1` in the settings of VM properly.*

The message you can see might be different, but we just focus on the name of the interface. In this example, it is `enp0s3` and you can treat it as the name of the adapter, please remember the one you see and we will use it later.

Type command below to modify the settings of interfaces:
